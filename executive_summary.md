# Modeling a Fast-response AI Wildfire Camera Network in Washington State 

## Executive Summary

Wildfire activity in the western United States continues to increase in frequency and magnitude.   Today's larger and more intense fires are increasingly difficult to manage than in years past.   According to the US Congressional Research Service, the average number of acres burned per year has risen to 7.0 million acres annually.   The figure is more than double the average annual acreage burned in the 1990s.

One silver lining is that off-the-shelf technology is developing which promises to help identify wildfires when they are extremely young.   If a fire can be identified within minutes to several hours of ignition, often a rapid-strike approach can be used to fully contain the fire before it grows and requires a broader response.   This could change the way we fight wildfires.  This technology includes:

1. High resolution visible band and infrared band cameras which can capture small, distant fires via smoke plume identification or radiation detection.

2. High-speed wireless data networks such as SpaceX's Starlink or terrestrial-based 5G networks provided by companies such as TMobile, Verizon,  AT&T, and others.   Point-to-point microwave, while not a new technology, has dropped in price considerably as well and should also be included in this class of technology.
3. AI-based image and video classification engines which can automatically identify wildfires from telemetry streams, with acceptable false-positive and false-negative rates.
4. Concurrent computing infrastructure, such as services offered by AWS and Microsoft Azure which can execute image classification in real time across multiple streams and escalate potential fires to human operators in an intelligent and efficient workflows.
5. Mature GIS platforms such as ArcGIS and QGIS which can help identify optimal placement of monitoring nodes.

Organizations such as [PanoAI](https://www.pano.ai/) and [AlertWildfire ](https://www.alertwildfire.org/) are already developing and/or integrating these technologies to achieve this goal of near-instant wildfire identification and rapid response management, and more information on their efforts can be seen on their respective websites.

Specifically, this project aims to identify pilot program candidate sites, across Washington State, for an initial deployment of fast-response wildfire monitoring camera installations.  It will identify and create a ranked list of candidate sites which consider fire risk, installation suitability, and wildfire monitoring coverage area.   The results of this study could be used to select a finite set of sites for a phase 1 trial of such a network in Washington State.
